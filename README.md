Data exploration project with SQL.

My second self-driven SQL project. Usinf Ryanair Pasenger Expierience reviews as dataset.
The dataset used can be found on public platform Kaggle. Author:CRIS,Ryanair Passenger 
Experience Reviews.

The dataset consists of passenger-reported ratings on seat comfort, cabin crew service,
food & beverages, ground service, and overall value for money.Detailed insights into the
types of travelers, such as leisure, business, or family, information on aircraft types,
seat types, routes flown, and dates of travel.A breakdown of passenger nationalities and
trip verification status.

The aim was to explore passanger preferences, and ratings, in context of different aircrafts, 
comfort levels, nationality, destination etc.
